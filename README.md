# Hey! What's up? 
I'm Brayan Mauricio and this is my GitHub repository where you'll find all my projects. I'm still a rookie in this world but I'm eager to learn and give my very best. I love building native android apps but I'm also interested in data science projects or embedded systems projects.

### Skills
- Jetpack Compose: I've been acquiring experience by creating modern declarative UIs for android using ![JetpackCompose](https://img.shields.io/badge/JetpackCompose-lightgrey?logo=JetpackCompose&logoColor=f5f5f5?style=for-the-badge).
- Java & Kotlin: I'm proficient in both ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-white?logo=Java&logoColor=f5f5f5?style=for-the-badge). & ![Kotlin](https://img.shields.io/badge/Kotlin-white?logo=Kotlin&logoColor=f5f5f5?style=for-the-badge). for building native android apps.
- ROOM: I use ROOM -  ![ROOM](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQLite-black?logo=SQLite&logoColor=f5f5f5?style=for-the-badge) for data storage in apps.
- Hilt & Retrofit: I implement dependency injection and retrofit for making RESTful  API calls.

### Another skills:
- R: I worked with ![R](https://img.shields.io/badge/R-lightblue?logo=r&logoColor=f5f5f5?style=for-the-badge) in an data analysis project using ETL processes.
- Python: Implemented ![R](https://img.shields.io/badge/pandas-darkgreen?logo=pandas&logoColor=f5f5f5?style=for-the-badge) for .CSV files manipulation and ETL processes.
- C++: I enjoy working different tech challenges with ![R](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-blue?logo=C++&logoColor=f5f5f5?style=for-the-badge)
